#CLOUD API

#An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API.   The API allows you to perform a variety of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes, adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.

  # Create a Data Center
  # Virtual data centers are the foundation of the platform. They act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g. servers. You can provision as many data centers as you want. Datacenters have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation. You can use this POST method to create a simple datacenter or to create a datacenter with multiple objects under it such as servers and storage volumes.

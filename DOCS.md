# ionoscloud

Ionoscloud - the Ruby gem for the CLOUD API

An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. 

The API allows you to perform a variety of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes, adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.

This SDK is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 5.0
- Package version: 5.0.0.beta
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.RubyClientCodegen

## Installation

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build ionoscloud.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./ionoscloud-5.0.0.beta.gem
```

(for development, run `gem install --dev ./ionoscloud-5.0.0.beta.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'ionoscloud', '~> 5.0.0.beta'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-ruby, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'ionoscloud', :git => 'https://github.com/ionos-cloud/sdk-ruby.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:

```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'ionoscloud'

api_instance = Ionoscloud::DefaultApi.new
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
  depth: 56, # Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on
  x_contract_number: 56 # Integer | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed
}

begin
  #Display API information
  result = api_instance.api_info_get(opts)
  p result
rescue Ionoscloud::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling DefaultApi->api_info_get: #{e}"
end

```

# **datacenters_post**
> Datacenter datacenters_post(datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Create a Data Center

Virtual data centers are the foundation of the platform. They act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g. servers. You can provision as many data centers as you want. Datacenters have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation. You can use this POST method to create a simple datacenter or to create a datacenter with multiple objects under it such as servers and storage volumes.

### Example

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'ionoscloud'
# setup authorization
Ionoscloud.configure do |config|
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure API key authorization: Token Authentication
  config.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = Ionoscloud::DataCenterApi.new
datacenter = Ionoscloud::Datacenter.new({properties: Ionoscloud::DatacenterProperties.new({location: 'us/las'})}) # Datacenter | Datacenter to be created
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)

# **k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post**
> Object k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post(k8s_cluster_id, nodepool_id, node_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Recreate the Kubernetes node

You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.  Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool's template creates & configures a new node, waits for status \"ACTIVE\", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty. While this operation occurs, the nodepool will have an extra billable \"ACTIVE\" node.

### Example

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'ionoscloud'
# setup authorization
Ionoscloud.configure do |config|
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure API key authorization: Token Authentication
  config.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR API KEY'

# **datacenters_servers_delete**
> Object datacenters_servers_delete(datacenter_id, server_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Delete a Server

This will remove a server from your datacenter; however, it will not remove the storage volumes attached to the server. You will need to make a separate API call to perform that action

### Example

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'ionoscloud'
# setup authorization
Ionoscloud.configure do |config|
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure API key authorization: Token Authentication
  config.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = Ionoscloud::ServerApi.new
datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the datacenter
server_id = 'server_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the Server
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
  depth: 56, # Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on
  x_contract_number: 56 # Integer | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed
}

begin
  # Delete a Server
  result = api_instance.datacenters_servers_delete(datacenter_id, server_id, opts)
  p result
rescue Ionoscloud::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling ServerApi->datacenters_servers_delete: #{e}"

# **datacenters_servers_put**
> Server datacenters_servers_put(datacenter_id, server_id, server, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Modify a Server

Allows to modify the attributes of a Server. From v5 onwards 'allowReboot' attribute will no longer be available. For certain server property change it was earlier forced to be provided. Now this behaviour is implicit and backend will do this automatically e.g. in earlier versions, when CPU family changes, the 'allowReboot' property was required to be set to true which will no longer be the case and the server will be rebooted automatically

### Example

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'ionoscloud'
# setup authorization
Ionoscloud.configure do |config|
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure API key authorization: Token Authentication
  config.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = Ionoscloud::ServerApi.new
datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the datacenter
server_id = 'server_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the server
server = Ionoscloud::Server.new({properties: Ionoscloud::ServerProperties.new({cores: 4, ram: 4096})}) # Server | Modified Server
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
  depth: 56, # Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on
  x_contract_number: 56 # Integer | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed
}

begin
  # Modify a Server
  result = api_instance.datacenters_servers_put(datacenter_id, server_id, server, opts)
  p result
rescue Ionoscloud::ApiError => e

# **datacenters_servers_reboot_post**
> Object datacenters_servers_reboot_post(datacenter_id, server_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Reboot a Server

This will force a hard reboot of the server. Do not use this method if you want to gracefully reboot the machine. This is the equivalent of powering off the machine and turning it back on.

### Example

```ruby

  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = Ionoscloud::ServerApi.new
datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the datacenter
server_id = 'server_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the Server
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
  depth: 56, # Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included.

}

begin
  # Reboot a Server
  result = api_instance.datacenters_servers_reboot_post(datacenter_id, server_id, opts)
  p result

  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure API key authorization: Token Authentication
  config.api_key['Authorization'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = Ionoscloud::VolumeApi.new
datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the datacenter
volume_id = 'volume_id_example' # String | The unique ID of the Volume
volume = Ionoscloud::Volume.new({properties: Ionoscloud::VolumeProperties.new({size: 100.0})}) # Volume | Modified Volume
opts = {
  pretty: true, # Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
  depth: 56, # Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included.
